1. **Model Training on 3 Classes**: Initially, a model was trained on a dataset containing three food classes: apple pie, omelette, and pizza. The training involved using a pre-trained ResNet50 model architecture.

2. **Visualization**: Accuracy and loss plots were generated to visualize the performance of the trained model on both training and validation data.

3. **Prediction**: The trained model was used to predict the classes of new images obtained from the internet. However, there seemed to be an issue with displaying the images, but predictions were made based on the filenames provided.

4. **Model Fine-Tuning on 11 Classes**: The process was then repeated with a larger dataset containing eleven food classes. The classes were randomly selected from a larger set of food categories.

5. **Visualization and Prediction**: Accuracy and loss plots were generated again to visualize the performance of the model trained on the larger dataset. Additionally, predictions were made for new images of cupcakes, spring rolls, and garlic bread.

Overall, the models performed well in predicting the classes of the provided food images, demonstrating effective training and transfer learning techniques.
